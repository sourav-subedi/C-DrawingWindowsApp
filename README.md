# 🎨 C# Drawing Windows Application

The C# Drawing Windows Application is an interactive desktop application built using C# and .NET (Windows Forms). This project demonstrates GUI development, event-driven programming, and object-oriented design principles in a Windows environment. The application allows users to create drawings using mouse-based interactions within a graphical interface, implementing custom rendering logic and structured event handling.

Key features include mouse-based interactive drawing, custom shape rendering on a canvas, event-driven input handling, modular code structure, and a Windows Forms graphical user interface. The project applies core software engineering concepts such as encapsulation, separation of concerns, structured debugging, and clean code organization. Graphics rendering is handled using the System.Drawing library, and user interactions are managed through event listeners.

Technologies used in this project include C#, .NET Framework, Windows Forms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Event-Driven Architecture.

To run the project, clone the repository using:
git clone https://github.com/sourav-subedi/C-DrawingWindowsApp.git
Then open the solution in Visual Studio, build the project, and run the application.

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of Windows desktop development, interactive UI design, graphics rendering, modular application structure, and event-based programming logic.
